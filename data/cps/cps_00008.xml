      <txt><![CDATA[CPSID is an IPUMS-CPS defined variable that uniquely identifies households across CPS samples. The first six digits of CPSID index the four-digit year and two-digit month that the household was first in the CPS. CPSID allows users to link a household record across samples, based on the 4-8-4 rotation pattern, by assigning a unique CPSID value based on a combination of household identifiers. CPSID will only ever appear for a maximum of 8 times, which is the number of times a household may be observed in the CPS survey (as indexed by MIS). In some cases, a household will appear fewer than 8 times due to migration, mortality, non-response, and recording errors. CPSID Extensive documentation about the creation of CPSID is available elsewhere.

CPSID may also be used to link ASEC respondents who are in the March Basic Monthly file to other months of CPS data. This linking is made possible by IPUMS through the creation of MARBASECIDP. Users should note that ASEC oversample households (as indicated by ASECOVERH) will always have a CPSID value of 0.

Users may also want to see CPSIDP for more information about linking individuals across time using a person-specific version of CPSID.]]></txt>

      <labl>Annual Social and Economic Supplement Household weight</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[ASECWTH is a household-level weight that should be used to generate statistics about households in March Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement data. The CPS uses a complex stratified sampling scheme, and ASECWTH must be used to produce unbiased household-level statistics from the IPUMS-CPS ASEC data. For analyses of non-ASEC data, researchers should use HWTFINL. For individual-level analyses, researchers should use WTFINL, ASECWT, or EARNWT. 

ASECWTH generally has the same value as WTSUPP for the household head or reference person. Vacant housing units and households that could not be interviewed due to residents' absence or refusal to participate have a value of zero in HWTSUPP; such sampled units were included in the public use CPS data beginning in 1988. 

Estimates on the entire population are prepared by projecting forward the resident population from the last available census. These projections are derived by updating the demographic census data from a number of other data sources that account for death, births and net migration. About 3 years after every census (i.e. 2003 for the 2000 Census and 2013 for the 2010 Census), the Census Bureau updates its independent population control and provides a new weight for the relevant years.

Two important points should be noted here. First, the lag between when the Census is conducted and when the CPS weights are updated is about 3 years. While the Census data are being processed, the CPS files are made available using the weighting scheme from the US Census prior to the latest Census. Second, once the files are updated, the old weights become obsolete and are replaced in the IPUMS data extract system. Published estimates from the lag years that use the old weights are not always updated. For example, 2010 poverty estimates were released in ASEC using the 2000 population controls. Once the 2010 population controls were made available, IPUMS-CPS replaced the ASEC 2010, 2011, and 2012 weights that are based on the 2000 population control with weights that are based on the 2010 population controls.

IPUMS-CPS makes available only the most up-to-date weights. The old values are available here: Old SPM and Weights Values.]]></txt>
      <codInstr><![CDATA[CodesASECWTH is a 10-digit numeric variable with four implied decimals.  That is, 1234567890 should be interpreted as 123456.7890.  The IPUMS command files automatically divide ASECWTH by 10,000, so no further adjustment is needed.]]></codInstr>

As there is insufficient geographic information in the public use data to determine which variable is in error, this mistake has been left un-recoded.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[CPSIDP is an IPUMS-CPS defined variable that uniquely identifies individuals across CPS samples. The first six digits of CPSIDP index the four-digit year and two-digit month that the household was first in the CPS. CPSIDP allows users to link a respondent appearing with a designated household roster line number (LINENO) across samples, based on the 4-8-4 rotation pattern, by assigning a unique CPSIDP value to this line number. CPSIDP will only ever appear for a maximum of 8 times, which is the number of times a household may be observed in the CPS survey (as indexed by MISH). In some cases, individuals will appear fewer than 8 times due to migration, mortality, non-response, and recording errors. Extensive documentation about the creation of CPSIDP is available elsewhere.

Users should note that it is important to verify CPSIDP linkages with AGE, SEX, and RACE. In some cases CPSIDP will result in erroneous links, which are due to errors in the source data. Cases with the same CPSIDP value may also have inconsistent responses across samples due to errors on the part of the respondent or in recording the response. Ultimately, it is up to the individual researcher to determine the acceptability of the linkages made using CPSIDP. 

CPSIDP may also be used to link ASEC respondents who are in the March Basic Monthly file to other months of CPS data. This linking is made possible by IPUMS through the creation of MARBASECIDP. 

To get started using CPSIDP, users may want to sort their data file by CPSIDP and MISH to create a person-time file. 

Users should take care when including the March Basic or ASEC as part of their linking. Respondents who are part of the ASEC oversample (as indicated by ASECOVERP) have a CPSIDP value of 0. For further information about the relationship between the March Basic and the ASEC, please see our additional documentation.]]></txt>

      <labl>Annual Social and Economic Supplement Weight</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[ASECWT is a person-level weight that should be used in analyses of individual-level CPS supplement data. Since the CPS relies on a complex stratified sampling scheme, it is essential to use one of the provided weighting variables.

Researchers should use WTFINL rather than ASECWT when they wish to conduct person-level analyses of non-ASEC data. EARNWT should be used for any analysis including a small number of person-level variables (EARNWEEK, HOURWAGE, PAIDHOUR, and UNION). Researchers should use ASECWTH for household-level analyses. ASECWTCVD is available for the 2020 ASEC to adjust for nonrandom nonresponse resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

User Caution: For analyses that include the 2014 ASEC sample, please see the comparability tab.

The ASEC CPS files include two groups of people who are not included in the production of published labor force statistics: (1) members of the armed services, and (2) members of the Hispanic oversample who were interviewed in months other than March. WTFINL and EARNWT assign these groups a value of 0. Both groups are assigned non-zero values in ASECWT.

ASECWT is based on the inverse probability of selection into the sample and adjustments for the following factors: failure to obtain an interview; sampling within large sample units; the known distribution of the entire population according to age, sex, and race; over-sampling Hispanic persons; to give husbands and wives the same weight; and an additional step to provide consistency with labor force estimates from the basic survey. 

Estimates on the entire population are prepared by projecting forward the resident population from the last available census. These projections are derived by updating the demographic census data from a number of other data sources that account for death, births and net migration. About 3 years after every census (i.e. 2003 for the 2000 Census and 2013 for the 2010 Census), the Census Bureau updates its independent population control and provides a new weight for the relevant years.

Two important points should be noted here. First, the lag between when the Census is conducted and when the CPS weights are updated is about 3 years. While the Census data are being processed, the CPS files are made available using the weighting scheme from the US Census prior to the latest Census. Second, once the files are updated, the old weights become obsolete and are replaced in the IPUMS data extract system. Published estimates from the lag years that use the old weights are not always updated. For example, 2010 poverty estimates were released in ASEC using the 2000 population controls. Once the 2010 population controls were made available, IPUMS-CPS replaced the ASEC 2010, 2011, and 2012 weights that are based on the 2000 population control with weights that are based on the 2010 population controls. IPUMS-CPS makes available only the most up-to-date weights.]]></txt>
      <codInstr><![CDATA[CodesASECWT is a 10-digit numeric variable with four implied decimal places. That is, values of 0012345600 should be interpreted as 1,234.56.  The IPUMS command files automatically divide ASECWT by 10,000, so no further adjustment is needed.]]></codInstr>

      <txt><![CDATA[RELATE reports an individual's relationship to the head of household or householder.

CPS interviewers collected detailed information about the precise relationships of all persons in the household in their initial listing of household members.  Unfortunately, they then simplified the detailed data (e.g., daughter-in-law, lodger's brother) by coding it into a few broad categories (e.g., "other relative of head," "nonrelative of head with own relatives in household") specified on the interview form.  Only the broad categories are preserved in the data.  The 4-digit codes for RELATE are consistent with the coding scheme used in IPUMS-USA census data.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[SPRULE is a constructed variable that indicates the method by which the probable spouse/partner link shown in SPLOC was identified.  

The IPUMS family interrelationship variables address two types of ambiguity when forming links. First, we prioritize links based on how clear the relationship is between the two people being linked. Second, we use a series of logical steps to select between multiple potential spouses. SPRULE is a two digit variables that show how these two types of ambiguity were addressed when forming a spousal link. The first digit indicates how direct the relationship is between the two people and the second digit indicates if the link was selected among multiple options and, if so, how it was selected.

We first prioritize links within a household based how clear the relationship is between the two people being linked (using RELATE). The priority of the link is captured in the first digit of SPRULE. Except for links between a householder and an unmarried partner, a person must be "married, spouse present" according to MARST in order to have a non-zero value for SPLOC.

      <txt><![CDATA[HISPAN identifies and classifies persons of Hispanic/Spanish/Latino origin.  Origin is ancestry, lineage, heritage, national group, or country of birth.   

Prior to 2003, information was collected by asking, "What is the origin or descent of each person in this household?" and asking the respondent to select the appropriate category from a limited number of choices on a flashcard (including "another group not listed.")   The choices included five to eight choices that would be classified as Hispanic, "Negro" and "Black," and a small number of European ancestry groups such as "German."  

The primary intention of the question was to identify Hispanic respondents, rather than origin or descent for the general population.  Beginning in 1976, the original CPS data preserved detail for only the Hispanic responses, with all others answers lumped together as "another group not listed" (relabeled "Not Hispanic" in IPUMS-CPS). 

In 2003 and later years, respondents were asked, "Are you Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino?" rather than the broad query about origin or descent.  Detailed information about Hispanic ethnicity was collected only from those who answered "yes" to this initial question.]]></txt>

Income due to disability could come from the following sources: worker's compensation; company or union disability; federal government civil service disability; U.S. military retirement disability; state or local government employee disability; U.S. Railroad Retirement disability; accident or disability insurance; black lung miner's disability; or state temporary sickness payments.

Most income variables included in IPUMS-CPS report the total amount earned from a specific source (e.g., wages and salary) during the preceding calendar year.  INCLONGJ, by contrast, does not necessarily include income earned during the entire calendar year.  Imagine that an individual worked at one job for eight months, earning $10,000 in wages, and then worked for four months at two different jobs, earning an additional $5000 in wages.  Wages from the longest-held job (in this case, $10,000) would be reported in INCLONGJ.  Wage and salary income from the two jobs other than the longest-held job (in this case, $5,000) would be reported in OINCWAGE. Total earnings from wages for this person (in this case, $15,000, accrued in three different jobs) would be reported in INCWAGE.  If, however, a wage-earner worked at a single job during the preceding calendar year, the amounts reported in INCLONGJ and INCWAGE would be the same. 

Amounts are expressed as they were reported to the interviewer; users must adjust for inflation using Consumer Price Index adjustment factors.

The amount earned (in wages, salary, or earnings from self-employment in a business or farm) from the longest-held job during the preceding calendar year is reported in INCLONGJ.     

Imagine that a self-employed individual worked in one non-farm own business for eight months, netting $10,000 in earnings, and worked in two other non-farm own businesses for the remaining 4 months, netting an additional $12,000 in earnings.  The $12,000 in "other" net self-employment earnings (from work outside the person's primary, or longest-held, job) would be reported in OINCBUS; the $10,000 in net earnings from the individual's longest-held job would be reported in INCLONGJ; and the total amount of net self-employed non-farm business earnings from the previous calendar year ($22,000) would be reported in INCBUS.

Imagine that an individual considered raising crops on her own land to be her primary job, and considered money earned by harvesting crops on another farmer's land for a few days, using her own equipment, to be a secondary "own farm" job.  In such a case, net earnings from the sale of  her own crops would be reported as income in INCLONGJ; earnings from harvesting crops for another farmer would be reported as "other" self-employed own farm income in OINCFARM; and the sum of earnings from crop sales and farm equipment rental would constitute INCFARM.  If, instead, she grouped together all net earnings from crop sales and income generated from the use of her equipment into a single "own farm" business, all of this net farm income would be reported in both INCLONGJ and INCFARM, and the value of OINCFARM would be zero.

      <txt><![CDATA[OINCWAGE reports the net amount (prior to deductions) that the respondent earned in wages and salary, other than the amount earned in the primary (longest-held) job, during the preceding calendar year.  The amount earned (in wages, salary, or earnings from self-employment in a business or farm) from the longest held job during the preceding calendar year is reported in INCLONGJ.

Imagine that an individual worked at one job for 8 months, earning $10,000 in wages, and worked at two other jobs for the remaining 4 months, earning $12,000 in wages.  The $12,000 in "other" wage and salary earnings (wages and salary from jobs other than the person's primary, or longest-held, job) would be reported in OINCWAGE; the $10,000 in wages from the individual's longest-held job would be reported in INCLONGJ; and the total amount of wage and salary income from the previous calendar year ($22,000) would be reported in INCWAGE.

Imagine, instead, that as reported in SRCEARN, an individual was self-employed in a business or farm for their primary job, and also worked one or more additional jobs for wages. In such a case, self-employment income from the primary job would be reported in INCLONGJ; all wage and salary earnings would be reported in OINCWAGE, and the value of OINCWAGE and INCWAGE would be the same.  

Amounts are expressed as they were reported to the interviewer; users must adjust for inflation using Consumer Price Index adjustment factors.]]></txt>

These recipients may have received SSI payments themselves directly as beneficiaries, or the payments may have been made to a parent or guardian on behalf of the child beneficiary. 

While the ASEC CPS for these years generally defined "children" as persons under age 15, government programs such as SSI use the more common definition of "child" as persons under age 18 when defining eligibility for benefits.

Persons under age 18 may qualify for SSI on the basis of being blind, severely disabled, or for other reasons, such as living with an SSI-eligible parent (SSI Caretaker Supplement benefits).  Children with disabilities qualify for SSI payments only if the income and resources of the child and co-resident family members fall within eligibility limits.  By contrast, only the income and resources of the individual are evaluated when deciding whether an adult (age 18 and over) meets the financial limits for SSI.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[EITCRED represents the value of the Earned Income Tax Credit for an individual or couple filing a federal income tax return. The federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a refundable tax credit that reduces or eliminates the amount of income tax that low-to moderate-income working people are required to pay, and it frequently operates as a wage subsidy for low-income workers.  If the amount of the credit exceeds the amount owed in federal income taxes, the difference is received as a cash payment. The value of the EITC depends on the amount of earned income and family size (e.g., whether a single-parent or two-parent family and number of dependent children).

The federal income tax on personal income provides for national programs such as defense, foreign affairs, law enforcement, and interest on the national debt.  "Federal income tax liability" means the amount of federal income tax, excluding any federal minimum alternative tax, taxpayers are required to pay.  A value of "00000" for this variable indicates no federal income tax liability.

Beginning in 2005, FEDTAXAC is added to the data, which indicates the amount of federal tax liability, after tax credits are deducted.

      <txt><![CDATA[FICA reports the total Social Security retirement payroll deductions for an individual or for a couple filing a joint tax return.  Social Security payroll taxes are collected under authority of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA).  Under this law, employers are required to withhold a share of employee wages and pay them to the government trust fund which provides benefits via Social Security.   FICA payroll taxes are thus both taxes and contributions to the social insurance system of Social Security, which funds retirement benefits, disability insurance, and survivor benefits.

FICA, like other tax-related variables included in the ASEC CPS (ADJGINC, CAPGAIN, CAPLOSS, EITCRED, FEDRETIR, FEDTAX, FILESTAT, MARGTAX, STATETAX, TAXINC, and household level variable PROPTAX) was not determined by direct questioning of respondents.

      <txt><![CDATA[FILESTAT reports the federal income tax filing status (single, married filing jointly, head of household, and non-filer) for individuals.  For joint filers, the response categories are further determined by age (over 65 years of age, or younger than 65, for one or both of the filers).  

Under IRS rules, an individual's tax filing status is partly determined by marital status on the last day of the year.  Unmarried persons and those who are legally separated or divorced, and who do not qualify for another filing status, must file as single.  With a few exceptions (i.e., those who were still married but who lived apart from their spouse for at least half the year), head of household filing status is reserved for persons who were not married and who paid for over half the cost of maintaining a home that also housed a dependent unmarried child, grandchild, or dependent parent.  Users should note that the "head of household" value for FILESTAT is not synonymous with identification as the household reference person in the RELATE (Relationship to head of household) variable.

FILESTAT, like other tax-related variables included in the ASEC CPS (ADJGINC, CAPGAIN, CAPLOSS, EITCRED, FEDRETIR, FEDTAX, FICA, MARGTAX, STATETAX, TAXINC, and household level variable PROPTAX) was not determined by direct questioning of respondents.

STATETAX, like other tax-related variables included in the ASEC CPS (ADJGINC, CAPGAIN, CAPLOSS, EITCRED, FEDRETIR, FEDTAX, FICA, FILESTAT, MARGTAX, TAXINC, and household level variable PROPTAX) was not determined by direct questioning of respondents.  Rather, values for these variables come from the Census Bureau's tax model, which simulates individual tax returns to produce estimates of federal, state, and payroll taxes.  The model incorporates information from non-CPS sources, such as the Internal Revenue Service's Statistics of Income series, the American Housing Survey, and the State Tax Handbook.  For more information about the model, see Current Population Reports, Series P60-18RD.  The IPUMS-CPS staff welcomes further information from users about the interpretation of this variable or other tax-related variables in the ASEC CPS.

In 2004, STATETAX started reporting negative dollar values.

Amounts for STATETAX are expressed in dollars of the given year, rather than in constant dollars adjusted for inflation.  Users can adjust for inflation using Consumer Price Index adjustment factors.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For income tax purposes, TAXINC, or taxable income, consists of adjusted gross income (ADJGINC) minus allowable itemized deductions (or a standard allowance amount) and exemptions for the taxpayer and his or her dependents.  Taxable income is the amount used in the calculation of an individual's income tax liability.

TAXINC, like other tax-related variables included in the ASEC CPS (ADJGINC, CAPGAIN, CAPLOSS, EITCRED, FEDRETIR, FEDTAX, FICA, FILESTAT, MARGTAX, STATETAX, and household level variable PROPTAX) was not determined by direct questioning of respondents.
